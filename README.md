# Numerical Math Parser

## Installation
Run the provided makefile and run the program.

## How it works
The program dynamically creates a binary tree based on the input string, where each node can either be a number or an operator. It later evaluates this tree to obtain an answer.

## Misc.
This parser is not meant to be a professional solution, it lacks some features of a full math parser, for example, algebraic symbols, it only accepts numbers, parenthesis and operators as input.
***This parser was made for fun, not to be a real solution.***
